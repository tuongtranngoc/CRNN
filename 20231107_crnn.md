# All Everything You Need To Know About Implementation of CRNN Algorithm

## Introduction
Text Recognition is a subtask of OCR, aimed at recognizing the content of one specific area. In the two-stage method of OCR, it comes after text detection to convert an image into a text. In this post, I will brifely give a high-level description of everything you need to know about the Pytorchâ€™s implementation of CRNN Text Recognition algorithm as described on the paper.
## How does CRNN works

The main contribution of this paper is a novel neural network model, it is specifically designed for recognizing sequence-like objects in images.
