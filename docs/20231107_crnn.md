# All Everything You Need To Know About Implementation of CRNN Algorithm

## Introduction
Text Recognition is a subtask of OCR, aimed at recognizing the content of one specific area. In the two-stage method of OCR, it comes after text detection to convert an image into a text. In this post, I will brifely give a high-level description of everything you need to know about the Pytorchâ€™s implementation of CRNN Text Recognition algorithm as described on the paper.
## How does CRNN works

The main contribution of this paper is a novel neural network model, it is specifically designed for recognizing sequence-like objects in images. Unlike general object recognition, such as object classification, object detection using DCNN models to operate on inputs and outputs with fixed dimensions, and thus are incapable of producing a variable-length label sequence.

For sequence-like objects, CRNN is designed to benifit advantages over conventional neural network models:

+ It can be directly learned from sequence labels (for instance, words), requiring no detailed annotations (for instance, characters).
+ It has properties of DCNN on leanring informative representations directly from image data.
+ It also has properties of RNN, being able to produce a sequence of labels.
+ It is uncontrained to the lengths of sequence-like objects, requiring only heoght normalization in both training and testing phases.
