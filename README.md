# CRNN
An unofficial CRNN implementation using Pytorch framework

The most typical CTC-algorithm is CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network), which introduces the bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to enhance the context modeling. And experiements have proved that the bidirectional LSTM module can effectively extract the contextual information of the picture, and finally enter the output feature sequence into the CTC module, and decode the sequence result.
